    "# Understanding the Double Pendulum as a Dynamical System\n",
    "\n",
    "## (i) Why the Double Pendulum Is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "The **triple pendulum** is an extension of the double pendulum and serves as a compelling example of **high-dimensional chaos** and **nonlinear coupled dynamics**. With three degrees of freedom, it displays an even more complex range of behaviors including higher-order bifurcations, multi-scale oscillations, and a heightened sensitivity to initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an engineering perspective, it offers a simplified but powerful analog to multi-joint robotic arms, suspension systems, and flexible spacecraft structures. It is also an ideal testbed for applying **Lagrangian mechanics** to high-degree-of-freedom systems where Newtonian analysis would be cumbersome and opaque.\n",

    "# Numerical Integration of the Triple Pendulum Using the Adams-Bashforth 2nd-Order Method (AB2)\n",
    "\n",
    "## (i) Why Use AB2 for a Nonlinear Dynamical System?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Adams-Bashforth 2nd-order (AB2)** method is a **multistep**, **explicit** integration scheme, and is especially well-suited to simulating nonlinear dynamical systems like the **triple pendulum**. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "- AB2 is a **second-order accurate method**. This means it has a local truncation error of order $ \\mathcal{O}(h^3) $, and the global error is $ \\mathcal{O}(h^2) $. \n",
    "- Compared to the **Euler method** (first-order), AB2 is much more accurate for the same step size and is thus a better choice for long-term simulations, especially for chaotic systems like the triple pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "- AB2 is an **explicit method**, meaning it doesn't require solving a nonlinear system at each step, which makes it computationally cheaper than implicit methods (such as implicit Runge-Kutta or backward Euler methods).\n",
    "- For systems where the evaluation of $ f(t, y) $ is computationally expensive, AB2’s **multistep** nature can provide efficiency by reusing previously computed values of $ f $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "- While **explicit methods** tend to be less stable than implicit methods, AB2 is a good choice for moderately stiff systems when small step sizes are used. \n",
    "- In chaotic systems like the triple pendulum, small step sizes are often necessary to accurately capture the dynamics, making AB2 a practical choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## (ii) Derivation of the Explicit Adams-Bashforth 2nd-Order Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The **explicit Adams-Bashforth 2nd-order (AB2)** method can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_{k+1} - u_k = \\Delta t \\sum_{j=k-1}^{k} \\beta_{j-(k-1)} f(u_j, t_j)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ u_k $ is the value of the solution at time $ t_k $,\n",
    "- $ \\Delta t $ is the time step size,\n",
    "- $ \\beta_{j-(k-1)} $ are the weights for the previous evaluations of $ f $,\n",
    "- $ f(u_j, t_j) $ is the evaluation of the right-hand side of the ODE system at time $ t_j $ and solution $ u_j $.\n",
    "\n",
    "For AB2, the weights are specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\beta_0 = \\frac{3}{2}, \\quad \\beta_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the update formula becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_{k+1} = u_k + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left( 3 f(u_k, t_k) - f(u_{k-1}, t_{k-1}) \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Truncation Error (LTE)\n",
    "\n",
    "The local truncation error for AB2 is of order $ \\mathcal{O}(h^3) $, and it is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau_k = \\frac{h^3}{12} u^{(3)}(\\xi), \\quad \\text{for some } \\xi \\in [t_{k-1}, t_k]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ u^{(3)}(\\xi) $ is the third derivative of $ u(t) $ at some point $ \\xi $ between $ t_{k-1} $ and $ t_k $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the method has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Order**: Second-order accurate (global error $ \\mathcal{O}(h^2) $).\n",
    "- **Error**: The local truncation error is $ \\mathcal{O}(h^3) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## (iii) Use of RK4 for Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Adams-Bashforth 2nd-order (AB2)** method is a **multistep method**, meaning it requires at least two previous time steps to compute the next value. Since we don’t have the second previous time step at the start of the simulation, we use a higher-order method to compute the first two steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RK4 Method:\n",
    "The general form of the RK4 method is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(t + h) = y(t) + \\frac{h}{6}(k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4)\n",

    "k_4 = f(t + h, y + hk_3)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use RK4 for Initialization?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RK4 Initialization**: The **Runge-Kutta 4th-order (RK4)** method is used to compute the first two values $ u_1 $ and $ u_2 $. Since RK4 is a fourth-order method, it provides highly accurate approximations for the first few steps.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **AB2 for Stepping**: Once the first two time steps are calculated using RK4, the AB2 method is used for the subsequent steps. AB2 is computationally cheaper than RK4 and works well for long-term simulations because of its **multistep nature**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize** using **RK4** (or another suitable higher-order method) to compute the first two time steps: $ u_1 $ and $ u_2 $.\n",
    "2. **Switch to AB2** starting from the third time step $ u_3 $.\n",
    "3. **Use AB2** for all subsequent time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hybrid approach ensures that the simulation starts with high accuracy and transitions smoothly to a more efficient method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithmic Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RK4 for Initialization**:\n",
    "   - For $ t_0 $ and $ u_0 $, use RK4 to compute $ u_1 $ and $ u_2 $.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **AB2 for Main Loop**:\n",
    "   - From $ k \\geq 2 $, use the AB2 method for the subsequent steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   u_{k+1} = u_k + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left( 3 f(u_k, t_k) - f(u_{k-1}, t_{k-1}) \\right)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Repeat this process for each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining RK4 for initialization and AB2 for stepping, we achieve both high accuracy at the start and computational efficiency in long-term integration. The use of **RK4 for initialization** and **AB2 for stepping** allows us to strike a balance between **accuracy** and **computational efficiency** when simulating complex nonlinear dynamical systems like the triple pendulum. AB2 is particularly useful for long-term simulations where computational cost becomes significant, and using RK4 to start ensures that we have accurate initial values for the AB2 method to operate effectively.\n"

    "# Convergence and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### (i) Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence behavior of the **Adams-Bashforth 2nd-order (AB2)** method is essential for evaluating its accuracy and stability. As stated earlier, the **truncation error** of AB2 is expected to scale as $ \\mathcal{O}(h^2) $, meaning that, with smaller time steps $ h $, the error should decrease quadratically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our convergence study, we examined the **error propagation** as a function of the time step size. This is shown in the graph below, where the error is plotted on a **log-log scale** against the time step size $ \\Delta t $. The slope of the curve in this log-log plot provides the **convergence rate** of the method. Based on the theoretical error rate of $ \\mathcal{O}(h^2) $, we expected the slope to be approximately 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the graph, we can observe that the **slope of the error curve** is **approximately 2**, confirming that the AB2 method follows the expected convergence behavior for a second-order method. This result validates that the method is **scaling at the expected rate** and that its error decreases as the time step size decreases, consistent with the theoretical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This convergence behavior is particularly important because it shows the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. While smaller time steps improve accuracy, they also require more computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (ii) Evaluation of Simulation Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to **accurately solving** the triple pendulum dynamics is selecting a suitable **time step size** $ \\Delta t $. A time step that is too large may result in **significant numerical errors**, while a time step that is too small may lead to inefficient computations with minimal improvement in accuracy. Therefore, choosing the optimal time step is a critical part of our simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the **optimal time step size** for our simulation, we analyzed the **relative error** as a function of the time step size. From our convergence plot, we observe that smaller time steps improve the accuracy of the solution. Specifically, we found that the smallest time step $ \\Delta t = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} $ resulted in the least error while still maintaining reasonable computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was determined by performing several simulations with different time step sizes, ranging from $ \\Delta t = 0.01 \\, \\text{s} $ down to $ \\Delta t = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} $. In each case, we calculated the **L2 error** between the solution from the AB2 method and the reference solution obtained by a high-accuracy method (such as RK4). The time step of $ 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} $ struck a balance between accuracy and computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our evaluation also considered **relative errors** across all state variables (e.g., $ \\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_3 $, and their velocities). The relative errors were found to **increase marginally** as the time step size increased, demonstrating the sensitivity of the triple pendulum system to numerical inaccuracies. These observations are important for ensuring that the method provides reliable results when exploring chaotic systems like the triple pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusive Convergence Validation\n",
    "The Adams-Bashforth 2nd-order (AB2) method was validated by comparing solutions at decreasing time steps (`Δt = 0.01, 0.005, 0.0025, 0.00125`) against a high-accuracy reference solution (`Δt_ref = 0.0005`). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observed convergence rate**:  \n",
    "  A polyfit slope of **2.2** on the log-log error plot (Fig. X) confirms the theoretical 2nd-order accuracy of AB2.  \n",
    "- **Error scaling**:  \n",
    "  Halving `Δt` reduces the error by a factor of ~4 (e.g., `Δt = 0.01` → `error = 0.045`, `Δt = 0.005` → `error = 0.011`).  \n",
    "- **Practical implication**:  \n",

    "To first demonstrate the working of out m=numerical method, we create functions `simulate_triple_pendulum_ab2` and `rk4_step`, with `rk4_step` aiding in the initalization of the time step for `simulate_triple_pendulum_ab2`, as mentioned in the beginning. We first produced Figure X, which futher demonstrates the workings of our system, which is just ag rpah tracking the energies. For our system to be realistic, we must incorporate conservation laws. Given that, the total energy $ E = T + V $ for all the pendulums should be **constant**. This graph, using the function `calculate_energies` demonstrates that, which confirms that system abides by the conservation energy laws. The graph also shows the accumulated error, which seems to be a bit higher during the chaotic phases, which would make sense for this type of system. \n",

    "This next figure shows the Phase space dynamics of our 3 pendulums. this gives way to answering question **2**. The only pendulum that shows any sort of periodicity is pendulum 1, which can be shown in the graph, which plots angular velocity ($\\omega$) vs. angle ($\\theta$). The first pendulum shows more of a quasi-periodic orbit. Pendulum 2 starts to go in the chaotic regime, but its way more \"stable\" then the Pendulum 3, which displaces completly chaotic behavior. Conclusively, pendulum 2 and 3 doesn't demonstrate any periodic or quasi-periodic orbital dyanamics as opposed to pendulum 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our Lyapunov Exponenet is $\\lambda = 0.032 $. With a positive Lyapunov exponent, this confirmst that the system is indeed chaotic, which we can see. This would mean that minute differences in inital conditions will lead to exponentially growing differnces in the systems behavior. The acutal magnitude of the exponent shows that even though t is chaotic, it doesnt exhibit such chaotic behavior as those with a $\\lambda = 1$. Although it is sensitive to initial conditions, it is less sentive to those of way more chaotic systems. Laslty, lambda gives way into the timescale of predicatbility loss, which shows up to what approximate time can we predict the bahevior of the system. Calculating this time scale predictability is shown below:\n",

The summary of the findings suggest that firstly, $\\theta_1 - \\theta_2$ show a strong anti-phase correlation, which essentialy means that when pendulum 1 move sin one direction, pendulum 2 goes int he opposite direction. That is whats shown in the graph, since it is mostly/strongly negative.\n",

This means that energy is being transfered from pendulum 1 to pendulum 3, but its delayed. this would give way to chatoci dynamics since it is indiccative of sensitive dependece on initial conditons, particularly that of pendulum 1. this would mean that pendulum 3 is affected by pendlumum 1 **over time**, so it is not directly coupled with pendulum 1 at all. this would make sense, since pendulum 3 showed the most chatic behavior them all.\n"
